# Scry R0 Current State

This file is a checkpoint, not a substitute for `git status`, `git log`, or tests.

## Branch safety

Active branch:

```text
rearchitecture/agent-first-scry
```

Never modify or rewrite `main` as part of R0.

Historical frozen baseline:

# Completed reset work

## R0.1 — Assurance reset — COMPLETE

Assurance was rebuilt around positive proof rather than absence of observed failure.

Key properties now established:

- explicit PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE/SKIPPED/NOT_RUN;
- required-result aggregation;
- independent browser fixture ground truth;
- positive and negative controls;
- legacy campaign machinery quarantined;
- old Praxis/Veil certification gates retired;
- real reference-replacement fixture provides external truth.

Important checkpoint:

```text
ed4e1fb test: establish assurance browser fixture ground truth
```

Current active Assurance truth suite at the last clean checkpoint:

```text
21/21 GREEN
```

---

## R0.2 — Chronicle reset — COMPLETE

Old `packages/artifact` identity was replaced with:

```text
packages/chronicle
@scry/chronicle
```

Clean Chronicle root exports factual events/artifact contracts only.

Legacy proof/admission/storage behavior is quarantined behind:

```text
@scry/chronicle/legacy
```

Existing:

```text
scry://artifact/...
```

resource naming remains intentionally unchanged.

Checkpoint:

```text
f01b525 refactor: establish clean chronicle boundary
```

Do not continue polishing Chronicle unless a concrete migration requires it.

## R0.3 — Praxis / Executor consolidation — IN PROGRESS

Goal:

> Praxis becomes the single authoritative browser substrate. Executor loses low-level browser ownership and is eventually removed or reduced to a temporary compatibility layer that can be retired.

### Closed pinned-reference / click slice

Commits:

```text
638ebf3 refactor: establish praxis reference interaction boundary
9a252a0 test: qualify praxis stale reference dispatch
4dcfd2f refactor: route executor click through praxis
1103dc3 fix: harden praxis pinned click dispatch
326a6ec test: correct praxis scope characterization
```

Proven properties:

- actual observed `ElementHandle` is pinned;
- page/frame/document identity is mechanical;
- no semantic re-resolution after pinning;
- main-frame click works;
- descendant hit works;
- same-origin iframe works;
- nested iframe works;
- cross-origin iframe works;
- ancestor overlay appearing during pointer movement refuses with zero button input;
- pre-existing ancestor overlay refuses;
- moved target refuses wrong-target dispatch;
- positioned click honors requested point;
- requested-point occlusion refuses even when center is clear;
- post-mousedown uncertainty is `unknown / unsafe / do_not_retry`;
- independent Assurance safe path PASSes;
- deliberately unsafe semantic re-resolution FAILs through the same oracle.

At checkpoint `326a6ec`:

```text
Praxis: 151/151 GREEN
Assurance truth: 21/21 GREEN
repo typecheck: GREEN
subsystem boundaries: GREEN
worktree: CLEAN
```

### Public native fill slice — COMPLETE

Checkpoint:

```text
861d543 refactor: establish praxis pinned public fill
```

Established:

```text
public native input/textarea
→ exact pinned browser entity
→ no semantic replacement
→ public Executor fill routes through Praxis
→ independent Assurance replacement oracle
→ unsafe semantic re-resolution negative control
→ conservative unknown/unsafe/do_not_retry after possible dispatch
```

Protected fill remained intentionally unchanged during this slice.

Qualification at closure:

```text
pinned-fill target/reference tests: GREEN, repeated
Praxis runtime dispatch-truth tests: GREEN
Assurance truth suite: GREEN, repeated
Executor affected runtime regression: GREEN
full Praxis suite: GREEN
Praxis/Executor/API typechecks: GREEN
repository typecheck: GREEN
subsystem boundaries: GREEN
```

Full commit:

```text
861d5439d202313dc29a29f5945915e97a2807fd
```

### Current active slice

Continue R0.3 with remaining public text-entry mechanics where active:

```text
contenteditable
focus_keyboard
non-native textbox mechanics
```

Then cut protected fill over to the same Praxis-owned browser mechanics while keeping Veil as the narrow trust/privacy authority.

Before doing anything:

```bash
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline --decorate
```

Do not reset work left by another agent.

# Important current architectural facts

## Executor

Executor still owns or participates in substantial legacy browser/runtime behavior.

Do not delete it before capabilities are deliberately migrated.

Target end-state:

```text
browser lifecycle and browser mechanics → Praxis
product orchestration → application/product layer
trust/privacy → Veil
facts/artifacts → Chronicle
qualification → Assurance
```

Then retire the obsolete Executor surface.

## Praxis

Praxis already contains much perception/reference machinery from the previous architecture.

Reuse factual/mechanical primitives where sound.

Do not preserve old semantic-admission authority merely because code exists.

## Vitract

Vitract is one live qualification surface.

It is not the architecture.

The old live blocker involved popup origin expectation versus actual allowed origin. That incident should be generalized into reusable browser/runtime behavior, not encoded as Vitract-specific policy.

# Known operating rule

When a new slice begins:

1. inspect exact current git state;
2. read only the directly relevant path;
3. prove the failure/ownership gap;
4. implement the smallest general migration;
5. add independent proof where feasible;
6. run targeted tests;
7. run relevant package/full regression;
8. commit and push a coherent checkpoint;
9. update this state file;
10. continue to the next ordered slice without waiting unless genuinely blocked.
